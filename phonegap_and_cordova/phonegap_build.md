3. Click `[New App]` in the top-right
4. Click the `[open-source]` tab
5. Copy/Paste the GitHub repository: https://github.com/nicholasareed/internal_app
6. Click `[Pull from GitHub Repository]`
7. Click `[Build App]`
8. Wait until the page refreshes, and the "Download" button is available (1-5 minutes)

You should now have a working, unsigned .APK download available for Android.
