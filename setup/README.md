# Installation Requirements
Please install the following libraries/packages.

## Node Version Manager (NVM)

https://github.com/creationix/nvm

## Node.js through NVM

Simple as:

    $ nvm install 0.10
    $ nvm use 0.10

This should also install the __Node Package Manager (NPM)__.

## Cordova CLI

    $ npm install -g cordova


## Android or iOS Toolkit (as needed)

You are not *required* to locally download and install the Android/iOS debug toolkits, but sometimes they are helpful! Specifically, it is useful to get Eclipse installed to debug some specific Android errors, or Xcode for iOS.


## Server Requirements

If you're building the Waiting/Internal App, it uses:

- Node.JS 0.10
- MongoDB (MongoLab)

(more details forthcoming)
