### How does this hybrid technique with Famo.us compare to other app-building methods?

The short answer: Using Famo.us for your View rendering is, to me, a revolution in accessiblity for myself as a frontend web developer. I can finally, legitimately, fool somebody into thinking I've built a "native" app , based on visuals and feel.

The long answer: It depends on your needs. If you're a team of Obj-C wizards who don't know a lick of Javascript, you'll probably be better served sticking to your guns. But, if you've been building front ends for websites in Javascript for any length of time, this technique can help you quickly create an app that would convince somebody into thinking you've built the app using the native toolchain on the platform (Obj-C, Java, C#), in respect to how it looks and feels through transitions and feedback.
